# polycutter
An interactive polygon cutting site to mess around with

### TODO

☐ polygon internal designs (stripes, decrease line strokes, etc)
☐ shearing (pushing polys along cut instead of perpendicular)
☐ flipping (need to add 3D to do this and then rotate around axis)
☐ switching of execution modes: cut (current), delete, drag
